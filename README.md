1. Install Matlab software. 
2. finished the cell formation at C/20 (2 cycles) for half cathode, half anode, and full coin cells at the Biologic tester
3. Export the file at BCS or VMP into .mpt files
4. Use the convert tools here to transfer the .mpt files into .mat files
5. Load and run the half cathode .mat files using the 'Stoichiometry_Cathode_V4.mlx' Live code 
6. Load and run the half anode .mat files using the 'Stoichiometry_Anode_V4.mlx' Live code    
7. Load and run the full cell .mat files using the 'Stoichiometry_Anode_V4.mlx' Live code
8. Check the figures and data 
9. For the technicial questions, please feel free to contact at Yongxiu.chen@eng.ox.ac.uk
